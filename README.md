follow the light cones and ascend to the runway level, if you want even more higher keep ascending stairs.

If you would like to listen to your favorite music while you play, just post the link to it in the comments ;)
I'll explain how to put music in the end of this description. (just scroll down)

-Your objective is capture all the capital markers (the big square with one triangle pointing to the right).
-Some military bases unlock speacial vehicles


MEANING OF EACH FUEL MARKERS NAME:

[A] = Ammo

[S] = Supplies

[F] = Fuel

You can manage your resources at base with the logistics menu at the scroll menu on the FOB range. To buy vehicle units and buildings go to the build menu at the scroll menu at the FOB range.

Also if you don't want a unit or vehicle anymore build the recycle facility and then recycle the vehicle or unit.

Also remember that capturing bases mean high enemy activity. SO do the side missions. To activate side missions you'll need intel points that you get capturing surrender enemy units, and capturing radios and wallets and documents. Activate by taking the Prisioner to the FOB. To do the side mission use the scroll menu at the FOB location. And watch the map to see the mission location.

You can also have sure that your friend won't break the rules. with the limited arsenal. with Items that are only of the player faction.
